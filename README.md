# Data Professions Egyptian Market Analysis

## Overview:
The data professions sector is rapidly expanding within the Egyptian job market. Despite this growth, there has been limited research and insufficient analysis in this area. This project aims to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive study on job market trends and opportunities in four distinct data professions, namely: data analysis, data science, data engineering, and machine learning engineering. We have gathered data from the renowned job portal [Bayt.com](https://www.bayt.com) to explore various aspects, including the demand for each profession, top hiring companies, geographical distribution of opportunities, required skills, educational backgrounds, and more.

## Data Collection:
The data was scraped from Bayt.com using the Python libraries of Beautiful Soup and Requests. <br>
While Bayt.com stands as a prominent career hub in Egypt, our analysis is constrained by its sole reliance on this platform for data collection. However, it's important to note that the platform still serves as a valuable indicator, offering significant insights into the industry trends and demands. Future analyses could benefit from a more diverse data collection approach, incorporating multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view of the dynamic job market landscape.

## Data Preprocessing:
The raw data was cleaned and processed where data was transformed into a standardized and structured format using Pandas and NLTK to enhance the quality of textual data for analysis.

## Data Analysis and Visualization:
The processed dataset was subjected to comprehensive analysis using Pandas, exploring various aspects of the job market. Key statistics, trends, and patterns were identified. The findings were visually represented using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other visualization libraries.
